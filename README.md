## Library

This is the Library project from the curriculum of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Path.

What is The Odin Project?
The Odin Project is a free open-source coding curriculum that helps students learn the necessary skills to become full stack developers from scratch. The curriculum is self-paced and makes use of online resources, such as tutorials, blogs, videos, and official documentation. Students learn from lessons and modules and build portfolio-worthy projects to master their skills in web development.
